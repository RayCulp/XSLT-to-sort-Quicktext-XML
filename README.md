# XSLT-to-sort-Quicktext-XML
An XSLT file to sort Quicktext XML 

## How to use this XSLT file on Windows
1. Download msxsl.exe  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21714
1. Export the Quicktext templates you want to sort as input.xml.
1. Open input.xml with Notepad and save as "UTF-8".
1. Download sort.xsl and sort.bat from this repository
1. Place all files (sort.xslt, sort.bat, msxsl.exe and input.xml) in the same folder
1. Run sort.bat. This should create a new file called output.xml. If this fails, you can run "msxsl.exe input.xml sort.xslt -o output.xml" from a command prompt. This will allow you to see any error messages generated by msxsl.exe.
1. Delete the unsorted templates from Quicktext to avoid having duplicates after the import process.
1. Import the output.xml file into Quicktext
1. Verify that your templates have not been corrupted by the XSLT before deleting your working files.
